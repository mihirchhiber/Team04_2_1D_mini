# Team04_4_1D_mini
1D mini hardware project FPGA code by team 04-02, 2020

My team and I have programmed the FPGA to check our physical full adder. Our FPGA can either check the adder automcatically or manually depending on the switches the user turns on. We have implemented Final State Machines (FSM), full adder, 3-bit adder and register to help us create an automactic/manual full adder checker.
